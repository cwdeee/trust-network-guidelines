# TRUST Network

The TRUST network aims to build a **transparent**, **transferable**, and **sustainable** foundation for psycholinguistic reading studies in German. The Network brings together more than 20 researchers in the field to develop transferable and sustainable guidelines that address critical challenges such as:

- methodological robustness  
- reproducibility  
- generalisability  
- statistical power  

The project will run for three years and provide funding for regular meetings for the network members. TRUST is funded by the **German Research Foundation (DFG)** and will run under the umbrella of **GeWoNN**.

We have regular meetings during which we strive to develop best practice guides for single-word reading research in German. Our long-term goal is to **establish a Reading Research Center in Germany**.

## TRUST Network Mission

The goal of TRUST is to **increase the quality of current reading research practices**. We aim to establish **best-practice** and **collective research guidelines** for the field, providing an optimal, transparent, and sustainable basis for across-lab investigations.

In the network, we bring together a group of expert researchers to compile:

1. **Transparent and consensual guidelines** for single-word reading research in skilled native-speaking German adult readers  
2. **Transferable guidelines**: an annotated version of the same German guidelines which will allow researchers to adapt them to different languages, participant samples (e.g., beginning readers, dyslexics), and paradigms (e.g., single word or text presentation)  
3. **Sustainable guidelines**: strategies to ensure that future studies in mono- and multilingual reading research have a **common, regularly updated foundation** for implementing high-quality investigations.
