## Before you start the experiment
Although lexical decision tasks are typically low-risk and low-cost experiments, one must know if they have the available resources. You need to consider several practical aspects before starting data collection, which are mostly the same as for other low-risk psychological experiments:

- Lab-based study: a quiet lab room with a computer
- Online study: Web server or funding for a hosting service. 
- Potentially funding for the research software, but be aware that there are multiple open source software solutions without costs. 
- Participant reimbursement: How much can I or am I expected to pay participants?
- Ethics permission: At present, ethics permission is not required by law but may be subject to university, funder, and journal policies. It is highly advised to obtain an ethical vote. In case your university does not have an ethics committee, one can consult the ethics committee of the DGPS (German Society of Psychology)
- Data safety and storage: In the European Union, data storage needs to comply with the GDPR (as of 2025). It is the researcher's responsibility to ensure that their experiment complies with the local and current standards. 

## Programming the experiment
The first step is to program the experiment: We want the experimental software to show each trial and to record the participantâ€™s response to the trial and the reaction time. A lexical decision task can be programmed with medium-low programming skills. Templates are available for beginners on many of the existing experimental platforms.

### Possible platforms to run the experiment
Here is a nonexhaustive list of programs used by the group in recent years. Typically, all solutions have a forum for customer support and examples available. Find more information at the webpages linked below.

The performance of the systems/platforms should be checked regarding the timing of the stimulus presentation and the latency of the key press. Information on this can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9414) and [here](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01501-5).

## Participants
The number of participants should be determined by a power calculation based on the size of the effect of interest (e.g., see [Brysbaert & Stevens, 2018](https://doi.org/10.5334/joc.10)).

There are no fixed rules about inclusion criteria. If the aim is to minimise inter-individual differences and examine differences on the word (or pseudoword) level, criteria can maximise similarity between participants (e.g., age, level of education). Possible recruitment strategies could be a convenience sample (e.g., undergraduate students), online platforms, or snowball sampling.

Unless it is relevant to the research question, we strongly recommend minimizing the number of additional questions. Every new bit of information reduces the anonymity, as identification based on the data should not be possible by law (i.e., GDPR rules). For example, if location, gender, and highest education are collected, identification in a rural region could be possible already. In addition, fewer questions reduce the testing time for participation. Such a questionnaire should be embedded at the beginning of the experiment. 

We recommend asking for:

- Language history
- Age
- Highest education
- Although gender is often reported and even requested by reviewers, we consider it irrelevant, as there is no evidence of moderation of the cognitive processes underlying reading in German adult readers.
