## Before you start the experiment
Although lexical decision tasks are typically low-risk and low-cost experiments, one must know if they have the available resources. You need to consider several practical aspects before starting data collection, which are mostly the same as for other low-risk psychological experiments:
- Lab-based study: a quiet lab room with a computer
- Online study: Web server or funding for a hosting service. 
- Potentially funding for the research software, but be aware that there are multiple open source software solutions without costs. 
- Participant reimbursement: How much can I or am I expected to pay participants?
- Ethics permission: At present, ethics permission is not required by law but may be subject to university, funder, and journal policies. It is highly advised to obtain an ethical vote. In case your university does not have an ethics committee, one can consult the ethics committee of the DGPS (German Society of Psychology)
- Data safety and storage: In the European Union, data storage needs to comply with the GDPR (as of 2025). It is the researcher's responsibility to ensure that their experiment complies with the local and current standards.
