Reporting the research process transparently will allow others to reproduce the study and build on your work. We recommend maximising transparency of the whole research process. For a lexical decision study, the following are the most relevant aspects:

## Rationale for the study:

- Research questions can evolve around novel exploration, phenomena, or existing theories of reading. Relevant German theories and computational models are the Dual Route Cascaded model (German version: [Ziegler et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1080/09541440050114570)), CDP+ ([Perry et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1080/09541440902978365)), or, more recently, the speechless reader model investigating orthographic processing with a neuro-cognitively plausible implementation ([Gagl et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.25.600635)).Â 
- Hypothesis: A pre-registration is highly recommended if the study is confirmatory and involves testing a specific hypothesis. Here, one should include the power calculation (to obtain the number of words and number of participants) and the statistical model, including the covariates and random effects structure. If highlighted as an exploration model, modifications can be conducted post-hoc but must be transparently reported.
- Exploratory analyses: If one cannot determine a hypothesis a priori, one should transparently report that the analyses are exploratory

## Documentation of contributions and sources

- Keep track of contributions to the study, relevant papers and discussions with collaborators.
- We recommend specifying author contributions using the CRedIT system to keep track and determine whether a contribution warrants co-authorship ([Holcombe, 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications7030048)).

## Methodology

- Keep track of the relevant choices and the rationale for the selection (e.g., "We used an inter-stimulus interval of 500 ms, as recommended by the TRUST guidelines"). 
- For the reproducibility of a lexical decision study, you need to specify:

    - Variable(s) of interest, along with rationale (if applicable)
    - The corpus used for word selection
    - Non-word generation process (with code as a supplement, if applicable)
    - Selection criteria for words and non-words(with code as a supplement, if applicable)
    - Specification of how word- and non-word-level characteristics were determined (with code as a supplement) 
    - A table with all item characteristics as part of the appendix or supplementary materials. 
    - A table with the mean values for each characteristic for words and non-words

    - Participant recruitment procedure, including procedure and justification for determining sample size 
    - Participant inclusion & exclusion criteria, including justification and definition (e.g., if participants with dyslexia are excluded: Why, and how was this determined?)
    - Number of participants, including an a priori power analysis, when hypotheses are tested, confirmatory
    - Pilot studies that were used to inform decisions, along with justifications (as appendix or supplementary materials)
    - Experimental setup: e.g., online, Lab, field or similar
