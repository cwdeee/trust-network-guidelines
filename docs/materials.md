### Word Selection in German: Variables to Consider
Here is a list of variables to be considered when selecting words for word recognition tasks like a lexical decision task in German. 

#### Exclusion of Taboo Words
Excluding taboo words can prevent participant traumatization.

#### Word frequency
A frequency cut-off can be used to exclude low-frequency words. 

Pro:

- Reduces the number of low-frequency words

Con:

- May not be representative of the language
- Requires additional work to determine the cut-off point

#### Word Length
Word length can be measured in letters or syllables. The pros of not excluding words based on length are:
- Simple in selection
- Most representative
However, the cons are:
- May not be representative of the language
- Requires additional work to determine the cut-off point

#### Part of Speech
Excluding certain parts of speech (e.g., function words) can simplify the selection process. However, it may also reduce the language's representativeness.

#### Inclusion of Compounds
Including compounds is relatively unique to German. The pros are:
- More representative of the language
However, the cons are:
- Many very low-frequency words
- A large number of words

#### Gender Forms
German words have gendered forms (e.g., "Lehrer" vs. "Lehrerin"). The pros of using gender forms are:
- Simpler selection rules
However, the cons are:
- Some words will only appear in one gendered form
- Male and female parts need to be matched

#### Inflections
German is an inflection-rich language, with different projects dealing with inflections in various ways. Including inflections can massively increase the possible number of words. For example, the verb "gehen" has 17 different forms, including "ging" (past form). The pros of including inflections are:
- Specialty of German
- Does not require an annotated corpus
- Closer to the actual use of language
However, the cons are:
- The experiment will be much longer
- More words included means more participants are needed

#### Lemmatization
Lemmatization involves using lemmas (base forms of words) instead of individual word forms. The pros of lemmatization are:
- Shorter list of words
- Lemmas have more overlap with other corpora
- Making inferences about a type based on the lemma RT is better than not having an RT of the type
- Many more practical applications of RT data with lemmas (e.g., evaluating text difficulty, predicting item difficulty)
However, the cons are:
- Lemmas are often not identical to what is seen or heard in natural language
