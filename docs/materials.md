-	Word selection in German — variables to consider:
o	Inflections
	Background: German is an inflection rich language; different projects have dealt with this differently (included or not: CITATIONS) — including inflections will massively increase the possible number of words (CITATIONS). 
	To note: German inflections can impact the stem (e.g., gehen —> ging [past form])
	Plural-single
	Pro inclusion: 
	specialty of German
	does not require a annotated corpus
	closer to actual use of language
	Con inclusion: 
	Experiment will be much longer, more words included means more participants are needed
o	On average 17 forms of a verb (CITATION)
	Many applications of lexical decision data will just use lemmas.
